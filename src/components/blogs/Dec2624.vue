    A Semester's Success <br />

  <p>Good morning!</p>
  <p>
    Today is December 26th 2024 so I would like to start this post by saying
    happy holidays! I’m fortunate enough to have spent the last few days with
    family and loved ones, and I am even still looking forward to celebrating
    Hanukkah with my girlfriend and her family. I hope your holiday season has
    been just as enjoyable!
  </p>

    I wanted to make this quick post as a final summary to say goodbye to the
    Fall 2024 semester as well as an introduction to my first winter semester.
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting this afternoon, and continuing until the 16th of January I will be
    taking <code>CS301 - Intro to Data Science</code> at NJIT. I’ve already
    taken some time to set things up on my laptop so that I can get straight to
    work. The course uses
    <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/book/"
      >O’Reilly Python for Data Analysis</a
    >
    which is conveniently available online and enabled me to get a pretty nice
    head start on the course’s material. I may do some writing about the
    material as I learn throughout the semester to keep myself sharp.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m feeling pretty good about the upcoming class considering the good news
    that came out of my first semester at NJIT - final grades have been posted
    and I currently have a 3.7 GPA! I really cannot express how much this
    accomplishment means to me. I am not someone who is naturally gifted nor did
    I have ambitious parents pushing me through the education system. In 2017, I
    just barely graduated high school and my GPA was so low that when I tell
    people most of them say “How did you even graduate??!!” After high school I
    worked for a few years doing IT for a physical therapy clinic before
    attending classes at a local community college where I slowly but surely
    found my footing in academia before transferring to NJIT. Fast forward to
    now and I’ve completely 180’d. My high school self would be in disbelief! I
    love school and I love what I’m learning. I’m more motivated than ever and
    my grades reflect my discipline.
